                    <p>Born and raised in Indianapolis I am a passionate web designer currently studying Informatics
                        and Media Arts and Science. I first found my area of interest in high school when I got
                        involved in programming classes where I found myself very involved and loved creating
                        interactive webpages. This combined with another area of interest that I commonly enjoyed doing
                        at the time being graphic design was something I enjoyed doing. Since young, I have enjoyed
                        drawing and painting and spent
                        hours wandering social media platforms gathering inspiration and knowledge that I now use in
                        combination with coding to create webpages.</p>

                                    well lit room. Something I learned from this painting excersise was the important
                                    value of patience as
                                    it takes time to let the paint settle before applying another layer.
